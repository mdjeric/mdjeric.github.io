<p>My education in Belgrade could be called “classical sociological”. From the first semester it was heavily focused on theory and methodology, with a touch of philosophy, and later concentrated on specific sociologies: from architecture, class, and gender, through media and history, to nationalism, ethnicity, and politics - to name just the very few. This was enriched with invaluable perspectives, knowledge, and experiences I gained studying and living in New York and Zagreb. Curently I am pursuing doctorate in the Southern Illinois researching diasporas from former Yugoslavia - and its largest communities are just few hours away in St Louis and Chicago.</p>
<p>My “hobby” is aviation, railroads, and in fact many things that have connections with transport and urban planning. One of the reasons for my fascination is how transportation is transformative for society, and profound effect it has on the way people live, from local structures to global ones. In addition, it clearly demonstrates relationship between technology and society. While groundbreaking discoveries and inventions are incredible, they have almost no effect on society if the need for particular technology does not already exist in one form or the other. In other words, if it doesn’t solve the already present or percieved problem. And, of course, I’ve always wanted to fly a plane. :)</p>
<p>While in high school, I was part of the team that one the first place on Hello Europe Quiz, org. by EU Delegation to Serbia. All the hard work was pulled by Srdjan Garcevic, a literal walking encyclopedia. You can visist his great website about stories from Belgrade, a true pleasure to read. Granted, I did recognize a super blurry photo of Rene Decartes, which were the points that pulled us over the line to beat the other schools in the finals. So it’s not that I didn’t do anything. :)</p>
